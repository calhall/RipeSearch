# RipeSearch

This script is designed to identify target IP ranges stored by RIPE NCC.

Ranges can identified using the following to search types:

String search [-s]: Searching for IP ranges registered to target registrants (e.g. 'Example Corp')
Domain search [-d]: Searching for IP ranges registered by individuals using a target email (e.g. 'admin@example.org')
